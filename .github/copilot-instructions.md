# AI Work Project - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive Python project with AI capabilities, featuring:
- Virtual environment management
- Pytest testing framework
- Comprehensive logging
- Environment variable configuration (.env)
- YAML configuration for AI properties (prompts, models, etc.)
- Clean project structure with src layout

## Checklist Progress
- [x] ✅ Clarify Project Requirements - Python project with AI capabilities, testing, logging, env/yaml config
- [x] ✅ Scaffold the Project - Creating comprehensive Python project structure
- [ ] Customize the Project - Add AI-specific configurations and features
- [ ] Install Required Extensions - Python extension and related tools
- [ ] Compile the Project - Set up virtual environment and install dependencies
- [ ] Create and Run Task - Set up development tasks
- [ ] Launch the Project - Test the setup
- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete - Finalize README and documentation

## Development Guidelines
- Use virtual environment for all Python operations
- Follow src/ layout for main application code
- Use pytest for all testing
- Configure logging through YAML files
- Store sensitive config in .env files
- Store AI prompts and model configs in YAML files
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
